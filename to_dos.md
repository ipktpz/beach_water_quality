 Environmental Correlations
Does water temperature or conductivity correlate with enterococci levels?

Explore whether warmer or more saline water impacts bacteria levels.

Do different times of day show different bacterial levels?

Analyze if mornings or afternoons are cleaner.

Do sites near the coast vs. inland show different quality levels?

Use latitude/longitude to cluster geographically.

🏆 Ranking & Scoring
Which swim sites are the cleanest (lowest average enterococci)?

Rank councils by the average water quality of their beaches.

🔮 Predictive Modeling (More advanced)
Can we predict enterococci levels using environmental data?

Features: temperature, conductivity, time, season, etc.

Can a classification model predict “safe” vs. “unsafe” swim conditions?

Define thresholds (e.g., >100 cfu/100ml = unsafe) and train a classifier.

📈 Visualization Ideas
Time series of water quality per beach.

Heatmaps by region or month.

Scatter plots of temperature vs. bacteria levels.
